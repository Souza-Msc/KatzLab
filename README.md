# SingleCellGermSoma

Hosts all the scripts that Xyrus X. Maurer-Alcalá developed for Characterization of Germline-Soma architectures in Chilodonella uncinata. 

Usage info is often found in the scripts themselves, although most will be as user friendly as possible (prompting the user for inputs if none are given in the command line)

These scripts were used for the following publication (please cite, if using):

"Maurer-Alcalá, X.X., Knight, R., L.A. Katz. Single-cell ‘Omics to Explore the Germline Genome of Chilodonella uncinata."
