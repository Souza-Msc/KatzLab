# Basic-Informatics-Katzlab-

Hosts all the scripts that Xyrus X. Maurer-Alcal√° has used for various projects. 

Usage info is often found in the scripts themselves, although most will be as user friendly as possible (prompting the user for inputs if none are given in the command line)

Do note, that scripts are being binned into folders by relative purpose. Inted was for names of scripts to be useful, but they may not be very helpful in deciphering what they do, so again open up script in a text editor and you can find more info there.
