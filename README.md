# HTS Processing for the KatzLab Phylogenomic Pipeline

Tools to Process HTS data in conjunction with the KatzLab Phylogenomic Pipeline

### For more information:
Request viewing access to [Katz-Lab SciWiki](https://sciwiki.smith.edu/katzlab_phylo/index.php/Main_Page) from current members of the Katz Lab at Smith College. 

There you will find detailed information about each major script (step) as well as more detailed information on assembler choice and the phylogenomic pipeline as well. 


#### Note about PostAssembly.tar.gz 

This pre-zipped file contains the folder structure and scripts ready for use and broken down by data type.


#### Databases for PostAssembly.tar.gz

These can be downloaded from: ["Post-Assembly from GoogleDrive"](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B7QiJDySGTwcSmtwNEdnUkpfUmc, "Post-Assembly from GoogleDrive")
