# Single-Cell 'Omics for Germline-Soma

Hosts all the scripts that Xyrus X. Maurer-Alcalá developed for Characterization of Germline-Soma architectures in Chilodonella uncinata. 

Usage information is found in each script. Also, notes on the intent of the script and other information is included at the end of the script itself.

For a rough outline of the steps and software dependencies needed, see the "Germ-Soma-Guide" file!

These scripts were used for the following publication(s) (please cite, if using):

"Maurer-Alcalá, X.X., Knight, R., L.A. Katz. Accepted. Exploring the Germline Genome of the Ciliate Chilodonella uncinata Through Single-cell ‘omics (Transcriptomics and Genomics)".

"Maurer-Alcalá, X.X., Yan, Y., Pilling, O.P., Knight, R., L.A. Katz. in prep. Twisted Tales: Insights into Genome Diversity of Ciliates Using Single-cell Genomics".
